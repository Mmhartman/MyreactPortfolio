##Learning by Doing: Embraced a hands-on approach, learning and applying new technologies to build this project.


##Why This Project Stands Out:
As a beginner eager to break into tech, this project represents my journey into web development and analysis. Each feature was implemented as a learning exercise, showcasing my dedication to mastering new skills. From creating a responsive design to adding interactive elements and applying analytical thinking, this portfolio reflects my commitment to growth and my readiness to contribute to the tech industry.
